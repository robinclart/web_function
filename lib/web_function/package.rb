  # Organize, document, and validate endpoints. A package facilitates {Endpoint} discovery and integration by providing
  # standardized metadata about them.
  #
  # A package bundles a base URL together with the endpoints it exposes, as well as optional metadata such as a name,
  # version information, top-level documentation, and a list of common errors.
  #
  # See the [package specification][0] on the Web Function website for the full description of every recognized key and
  # its constraints.
